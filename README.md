# Insulin-Calculator
One of my first programs, made to try building javascript-read HTML forms. 
A simple calculator for how many units of insulin to take with a meal depending on current blood sugar levels and approximate meal size. 
Currently uses magic numbers for carb ratios, meal size, correction factor etc, that is, the numbers I was using for those factors 
when I was first diagnosed with T1D (shortly before I wrote this app).

Live version available to try at https://nymphofthevales.com/content/insulin/.
